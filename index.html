            <h3>What is cyber security</h3>
            <h6>A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, software, or data that one wishes to preserve. People, processes, and technology must complement each other within an organization to create an effective defense against cyberattacks. A unified threat management system can automate integrations across select Cisco Security products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation.</h6>

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <h6>Providing technology is essential to give organizations and individuals the cybersecurity tools needed to protect themselves from cyber attacks. Three main entities must be protected: peripheral devices such as computers, smart devices, routers, networks, and the cloud. Common forms of technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, and email security solutions</h6>

            <h3>Processes</h3>
            <h6>In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense software. On an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in many things, from identity theft to extortion attempts to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure such as power plants, hospitals and financial services companies. Securing these and other institutions is essential to keeping our society functioning.</h6>

            <h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
            <h6>Everyone also benefits from the work of cyber threat researchers, like the Talos team of 250 researchers, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyber attack strategies. They work to expose new vulnerabilities, educate the public about the importance of cybersecurity, and support open source tools. Their efforts make the Internet a safer place for everyone</h6>
